# 🚀 Production-Ready Dynamic Agent Orchestration

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your dynamic agent orchestration system is now **production-ready** with Inngest + Agent-Kit integration!

## 🎯 What's Been Built

### 1. **System Agent Prompts** (`src/lib/services/system-prompts.ts`)
- ✅ Task Planner - Breaks down requirements
- ✅ Logic Checker - Validates work quality
- ✅ Orchestrator - Creates specialized agents dynamically
- ✅ Code Feedback Agent - Reviews code like a senior dev
- ✅ Clarifier - Asks clarifying questions
- ✅ `generateSpecializedAgentPrompt()` - Creates custom prompts for dynamic agents

**Supported Specializations:**
- Frontend Expert, Backend Expert, DevOps Expert
- Testing Expert, Integration Expert, Database Expert
- Security Expert, Mobile Expert, AI/ML Expert

### 2. **Orchestrator Tools** (`src/lib/tools/orchestrator-tools.ts`)
All tools guarantee structured output via Zod schemas:

- ✅ `generatePlanTool` - Task Planner outputs structured plans
- ✅ `validateWorkTool` - Logic Checker outputs validation results
- ✅ `createSpecializedAgentsTool` - Orchestrator creates agents in DB
- ✅ `reviewCodeTool` - Code Feedback outputs detailed reviews
- ✅ `askClarifyingQuestionsTool` - Clarifier asks structured questions

### 3. **E2B Sandbox Tools** (`src/lib/tools/sandbox-tools.ts`)
Production-ready tools for specialized agents:

- ✅ **File Operations** - Create, read, update, delete, list files
- ✅ **Terminal** - Execute shell commands with timeout
- ✅ **Search** - Find patterns in code (grep-based)
- ✅ **Code Analysis** - Analyze structure, dependencies, imports
- ✅ **Git Operations** - Version control operations
- ✅ **Package Manager** - npm/yarn/pnpm/bun support

### 4. **Dynamic Agent Loader** (`src/lib/services/dynamic-agent-loader.ts`)
- ✅ Loads specialized agents from database
- ✅ Creates Agent-Kit agents with custom prompts
- ✅ Assigns E2B sandbox tools
- ✅ Handles both Anthropic and OpenAI models
- ✅ Creates review agents (Code Feedback + Logic Checker)
- ✅ **Guarantees every agent has tools for structured output**

### 5. **Complete Workflow Function** (`src/lib/inngest/workflow-function.ts`)
Production-ready 380+ line Inngest function with:

**Phase 1 - Planning:**
1. ✅ Task Planning with validation loop
2. ✅ Logic Check with retry (up to 3 attempts)
3. ✅ Orchestrator creates specialized agents
4. ✅ Agents saved to database with custom prompts
5. ✅ **PAUSE** for human approval (24-hour timeout)

**Phase 2 - Execution:**
6. ✅ Loads specialized agents from DB
7. ✅ Creates Agent-Kit agents with E2B tools
8. ✅ Executes tasks in order (supports parallel execution)
9. ✅ Code Feedback review for each task
10. ✅ Logic Check validation with retry loop
11. ✅ Realtime progress streaming to UI

**Features:**
- ✅ Step-by-step Inngest observability
- ✅ Automatic retries with feedback
- ✅ Parallel task execution (by order)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Realtime UI updates via events

### 6. **Database Migration** (`migrations/20251009232746_add_dynamic_agent_fields.sql`)
- ✅ Added `execution_id` to agents table
- ✅ Added `inngest_run_id` to executions
- ✅ Added `channel_id` for realtime streaming
- ✅ Added `step_id` to tasks
- ✅ Added `attempts` for retry tracking
- ✅ Indexes for fast lookups
- ✅ Helper functions (`get_agents_by_execution`, `get_pending_tasks_for_execution`)

### 7. **Database Functions** (`src/lib/db/agents.ts`)
- ✅ `getAgentsByExecution()` - Retrieve all dynamic agents for an execution
- ✅ All database operations properly typed with Agent interface
- ✅ Error handling via handleDbError wrapper

### 8. **Server Actions** (`src/server/actions/workspace.ts`)
- ✅ `fetchSubscriptionToken()` - Get realtime subscription
- ✅ `runSimpleAgent()` - Trigger simple agent
- ✅ `runWorkflowAgents()` - Start workflow orchestration
- ✅ `resumeWorkflowExecution()` - Resume after approval

## 📋 How It Works

### Example: "Build an e-commerce app"

```
User submits: "Build a full-stack e-commerce app with React and Node"
    ↓
[Phase 1: Planning]
    ↓
Task Planner creates breakdown:
  - Frontend: Product listing, cart, checkout UI
  - Backend: API endpoints, database schema
  - Payment: Stripe integration
  - Auth: User authentication
  - Testing: Unit and E2E tests
    ↓
Logic Checker validates plan
    ↓
Orchestrator creates specialized agents:
  1. Frontend Expert (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
     System Prompt: "You are an expert frontend developer specializing in React..."
     Tools: file_operations, terminal, search

  2. Backend Expert (Node.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma)
     System Prompt: "You are an expert backend developer..."
     Tools: file_operations, terminal, package_manager

  3. Payment Integration Specialist (Stripe)
     System Prompt: "You are an expert in payment integrations..."
     Tools: file_operations, terminal, search

  4. Testing Engineer (Jest, Playwright)
     System Prompt: "You are an expert testing engineer..."
     Tools: file_operations, terminal
    ↓
Agents saved to database with custom prompts
    ↓
[PAUSE] - User sees:
  - Task breakdown
  - 4 specialized agents
  - Their skills and responsibilities
    ↓
User clicks "Approve and Execute"
    ↓
[Phase 2: Execution]
    ↓
Each specialized agent executes their tasks:
  - Frontend Expert creates React components
  - Backend Expert builds API endpoints
  - Payment Specialist integrates Stripe
  - Testing Engineer writes tests
    ↓
After each task:
  → Code Feedback Agent reviews
  → Logic Checker validates
  → Retry if needed (up to 3 attempts)
    ↓
✅ Workflow completed!
```

npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```
Opens at: http://127.0.0.1:8288/

### 3. Start Your App
```bash
bun dev
```

### 4. Test the Workflow

**From Chat UI:**
```typescript
// User selects "Agents" mode
// Types: "Build a todo app with React"
// Clicks send

// Backend triggers:
await runWorkflowAgents(projectId, "Build a todo app with React");

// Watch Inngest Dashboard for:
// - Step-by-step execution
// - Agent creation
// - Task execution
// - Validation loops
```

**Monitor in Inngest Dashboard:**
- See each step execute

- ✅ Fixed all 'any' types in workflow-function.ts and orchestrator-tools.ts
- ✅ Verified proper type safety throughout the codebase
- ✅ All agent creation follows established coding-agent.ts pattern

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Agents not created
- Check Inngest dashboard for errors
- Verify database connection
- Check team_id is valid

**Issue:** Tasks not executing
- Verify E2B sandbox is running
- Check sandbox API key
- Review task order in metadata

**Issue:** Validation loops infinitely
